  ;; 1. ee-datafile-mode is called directly by M-x;
  ;; 2. user calls some interactive command for visiting files
  ;;    and after file is visited, ee-datafile-mode is called as
  ;;    a result of file having -*- ee-datafile -*- in the first row.
  ;; But ee-datafile isn't called if file is visited during
  ;; Emacs startup (by package "desktop.el", etc.),
  ;; because this will report startup error.
  ;; This is BAD hack. TODO: BETTER hack :-)
